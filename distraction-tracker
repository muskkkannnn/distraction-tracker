About Distraction Tracker:

2. Screen 1: The landing screen allows the user to track the number of distractions by choosing a number from the count increase and decrease buttons and adding the chosen number to the main headline / announcement using a button (similar to 'choose quantity and add' feature on e-commerce product pages).
